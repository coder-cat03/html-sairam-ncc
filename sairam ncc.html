    <p>The NCC in India was formed in 1948. It can be traced back to the ‘University Corps’, which was created under the Indian Defence Act 1917,<br> with the objective to make up for a shortage of personnel in the Army.<br> In 1920, when the Indian Territorial Act was passed, the ‘University Corps’ <br>was replaced by the University Training Corps (UTC). The aim was to raise the status of the UTC and make it more attractive to the youth.<br> UTC Officers and cadets wear Army uniform. It was a significant step towards the 'Indianisation' of the Indian armed forces.<br /> It was renamed the UOTC so the National Cadet Corps can be considered a successor to the University Officers Training Corps (UOTC)<br /> which was established by the Government of India in 1942. During World War II, the UOTC never came up to the expectations set by the British.<br> This led to the idea that some better schemes should be formed, which could train more young men in a better way, even during peace.<br /> A committee headed by H. N. Kunzru recommended a cadet organization to be established in schools and universities at a national level.<br> The soldier youth foundation Act was accepted by the Governor General, and on the 15th of July 1950 the soldier youth foundation came into existence.</p>

    <p>In 1949, the Girls Division was formed in order to provide equal opportunities to school and college-going girls.<br> The NCC was given an inter-service image in 1950 when the Air Wing was added,<br> followed by the Naval Wing in 1952. In the same year, the NCC curriculum was extended to<br> include community development/social service activities as a part of the NCC syllabus at the behest of<br> Late Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru who took a keen interest in the growth of the NCC. Following the 1962 Sino-Indian War,<br> to meet the requirement of the Nation, NCC training was made compulsory in 1963.<br /> This was discontinued in 1968, when the Corps was again made voluntary.[4]</p>
